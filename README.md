This is a simple portfolio showcasing my web development projects. I have created this portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate my skills and showcase the work I have done.

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of my projects, including websites I have developed, interactive web applications, and other web-related work. Each project is accompanied by a description that highlights its purpose, features, and technologies used.

I am a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a keen eye for design and strive to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and browse through my projects. If you have any questions, feedback, or collaboration opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub portfolio!
